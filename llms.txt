# AI Query Revealer

> The first Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Chrome extension. Intercepts hidden AI search queries from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini in real time.

## What It Does

AI Query Revealer is a Chrome extension that reveals the hidden web searches performed by AI platforms. When you ask ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini a question, the AI silently generates 3-12 hidden search queries, consults 12+ web sources, and decides which sites to cite. AI Query Revealer intercepts this invisible process and displays it in real time.

Unlike competitors that simulate prompts via API (PromptMonitor, Knowatoa, Otterly), AI Query Revealer captures the actual fetch requests and Server-Sent Event (SSE) streams from AI platforms as they happen. This means users see real queries, real sources, and real citation decisions — not estimates.
